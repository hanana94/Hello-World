###About my day
* Two of my classes were canceled today.
 1. MAT 401
 2. MAT 485  
  Though most of us **did** meet up to hash out an algorithm, and we did! Well...Michael and Nathan did.
* I learned MarkDown today and I feel _pretty_ cool. 
* The Math Club meeting was extremely brief
* I helped give a presentation to some Honors Students about [SURC](http://nau.edu/Undergraduate-Research/Student-Undergraduate-Research-Council/)
* Finally, I got home and ate some [pizza](http://scene7.samsclub.com/is/image/samsclub/0007192127254_A?$img_size_380x380$) and a kale salad. **YUM**
